The Polar Satellite is Launch at 10:00 am from the first launch  at 10:24 am with all 19 satellites including Amazonia-1.\r\n\r\nAt 10.24 a.m. the 44.4 metre tall PSLV-C51 rocket blasted off from the first launch pad here laden with 19 satellites-foreign and Indian- and slowly rose-up towards the skies with thick orange flame at its tail.\r\n\r\nThe rocket slowly gained speed as it went up while emitting a rolling thunder sound. Seventeen minutes into its flight the rocket slung its primary passenger the Brazilian satellite Amazonia-1 - the first of the 19 satellites- into its intended Sun Synchronous Orbit.\r\n\r\nAmazonia-1 is the optical earth observation satellite of National Institute for Space Research (INPE). This satellite would further strengthen the existing structure by providing remote sensing data to users for monitoring deforestation in the Amazon region and analysis of diversified agriculture across the Brazilian territory, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said.\r\n\r\nWith this India has slung 329 foreign satellites till date. If all goes well, then India will end the mission orbiting a total of 342 foreign satellites, all for a fee.\r\n\r\nIndia\'s first space mission for 2021 is one of the longest for a PSLV rocket is expected to conclude 1 hour, 55 minutes and 7 seconds into its flight. The rocketing is a fully commercial one of NewSpace India Ltd (NSIL).\r\n\r\nThe 18 co-passenger satellites include four from IN-SPACe (three UNITYsats from consortium of three Indian academic institutes (Jeppiaar Institute of Technology, Sriperumbudur, G.H.Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur and Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore), one Satish Dhawan Sat from Space Kidz India) with an engraved picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as Bhagavad Gita in a flash.\r\n\r\nThe remaining 14 satellites are Sindhu Netra, an Indian technology demonstration satellite from Defence Research Development Organisation\'s (DRDO) research centre Imarat, Hyderabad to identify suspicious ships and 13 satellites from the USA viz., SAI-1 NanoConnect-2, a technology demonstration satellite and 12 SpaceBees satellites for two-way satellite communications and data relay.\r\n\r\nFor the third time ISRO is using the PSLV rocket\'s DL variant that will have two strap-on booster motors.\r\n\r\nIn normal configuration the PSLV is a four stage/engine expendable rocket powered by solid and liquid fuels alternatively. Six booster motors will also be strapped on to the first stage to give higher thrust during the initial flight moments.\r\n\r\nBut the PSLV rocket that flew on Sunday was the DL variant having only two strap-booster motors. This rocket variant was used the first time to put the Microsat R satellite into orbit on January 24, 2019. The Indian space agency has PSLV variants with two and four strap-on motors, larger PSLV-XL and the Core Alone variant without any strap-on motors. The choice of the rocket to be used for a mission depends on the weight of the satellite and the orbit where the satellite has to be orbited. Be that as it may, the PSLV-C51 mission is one of longest ones.\r\n\r\nAs per its flight plan, the rocket will put the 19 satellites into Sun Synchronous Orbit over a duration of 1 hour, 55 minutes and 7 seconds. During its flight, the rocket\'s fourth stage engine will be cut off and restarted a couple of times, the first one will be at 16 minutes into its flight. Just over one hour into its flight the rocket\'s engine will be restarted for about nine seconds before it is shut down again.\r\n\r\nAfter 1 hour, 49 minutes and 52 seconds the rocket\'s engine will be reignited for eight seconds after which the 18 piggy back satellites will be put into orbit.\r\n\r\n', 'article05.png.png', 'Industry', '2024-10-05 18:30:00', ''),

Culinary and dining experiences can also impact global tourism. Luxury Group, the collective of high-end hotels within the Marriott International portfolio, recently launched the Future of Food Report 2025 for the Asia-Pacific (Apac) region. The report drew insights from research and in-depth interviews with over 30 pioneering chefs, mixologists, and industry insiders across the Asia Pacific region. As per the report, Asian cuisine is rising in popularity and recognition. \r\n\r\nCan an Asian restaurant become the number one restaurant in the world? That future is now entirely possible, says the report. Cuisines from the \"global south\", including the Asia Pacific region, are receiving more Michelin stars than Western restaurants in Central London. Apac is no longer seen as an \"emerging\" dining destination. Rather, it has risen to be on par with Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to Asian food, Japanese cuisine has always had a significant influence on the world. Further, chefs in Turkey, Copenhagen and Spain are taking Cantonese cuisine to a global audience. India\'s food culture has also been a source of inspiration for many. \"The use of vibrant spices like cumin, turmeric, and cardamom that add depth to the concept of vegetarianism and art of cooking in tandoor has inspired chefs and food enthusiasts worldwide to embrace new flavours and explore culinary creativity,\" notes Prateek Sadhu of Naar, a restaurant at the foothills of the Himalayas in India.\r\n\r\nThe rise of culinary tourism in the Asia Pacific has transformed the continent into a premier dining destination, attracting travellers from around the globe. One such up-and-coming culinary capital identified by the report is Mumbai, India. Mumbai\'s diverse dining scene reflects the city\'s social and economic disparity and history as a melting pot of migrants, says the report. The top restaurants identified include Masque, Ekaa and Noon. \r\n\r\nHere are all 10 up-and-coming culinary capitals around the world in the Asia Pacific:\r\n\r\n1. Bali, Indonesia\r\n2.

According to the New York Times, the police made the grisly discovery earlier this month at a residence in Jal \"associated with rumours of human remains\". The Lea County sheriff, Corey Helton, said the investigators have sent the fragments to a state lab for testing any potential identification, which could take up to a month. For now, investigators don\'t know if the bones were ancient or if they could be linked to any missing persons or homicide cases, he added. \r\n\r\nBut investigators are \"actively examining the possibility that some, if not all, of the human remains may have been purchased online,\" the sheriff\'s office continued, per New York Times. \"Everything is based on what we find out from the anthropologist, which will dictate what direction we go,\" Sheriff Helton said.\r\n\r\nAccording to the New York Post, authorities began investigating after they received a call from a resident who reported an \"unsettling encounter\" while offering someone a ride on November 5. The resident claimed that the passenger, identified as Cecil Villanueva, \"made alarming statements\" and threw items from his vehicle - some of which \"appeared to be human bones,\" police said.\r\n\r\nCops searched the area near a convenience store and found bone fragments that a pathologist confirmed as human. Authorities then searched Villanueva\'s home the following day and discovered additional bone fragments, including part of a skull and jawbone. Police stated that \"10-20\" human skulls were discovered during a second search of the house three days later. \r\n\r\nSheriff Helton said that investigators are now exploring whether some of the skull pieces might be linked to the disappearance of a Jal resident, Angela McManes, who was last seen in May 2019. She reportedly lived on the same street as the property where the bone fragments were discovered. But the sheriff\'s office said that, so far, \"there does not appear to be a link\" to Ms McManes, beyond the proximity of her home to the property where the skull fragments were found.\r\n\r\n\"Authorities are working diligently to determine the connection between the remains and McManes, as well as other possible victims,\" the sheriff\'s office said.\r\n\r\nCecil Villanueva has been charged with criminal trespass, a misdemeanour.

(15, 'Crime', 'Cryptocurrency Mixer Bitcoin Fog Convicted of Crypto Money Laundering The verdict is the latest win for the US in a crackdown on crypto criminals.', 'The founder of a cryptocurrency mixing service known as Bitcoin Fog was convicted in Washington federal court of helping to launder tens of millions of dollars from darknet markets known for selling illegal drugs.\r\n\r\nA jury on Tuesday concluded Roman Sterlingov, 35, provided a service that jumbled digital tokens to make it more difficult to find the source of proceeds from illegal activities. Prosecutors said Bitcoin Fog processed more than $400 million (roughly Rs. 3,375 crore) in untraceable transactions, including $78 million (roughly Rs. 658 crore) involving known darknet markets. \r\n\r\nThe verdict is the latest win for the US in a crackdown on crypto criminals, including the November conviction of FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried. Sterlingov, a Russian-Swedish national who testified in his own defense and denied he ever ran Bitcoin Fog, faces up to 20 years in prison on the most serious charges. Sterlingov, who\'s been in custody for nearly three years, will be sentenced on July 15. \r\n\r\n“The defendant set up the whole operation to help criminals hide their assets,” prosecutor Catherine Pelker told jurors during closing arguments. Pelker said it is clear from the evidence that Sterlingov was “instrumental” in setting up Bitcoin Fog.\r\n\r\nAfter about two days of deliberations, jurors found Sterlingov guilty on all four counts, which included conspiring to launder money, money laundering, and two charges related to running an unregistered money transmitting service.\r\n\r\n“Darknet criminals should know by now that operations like Bitcoin Fog cannot provide the anonymity for cryptocurrency transactions that they claim they can,” Matthew M. Graves, the US Attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement.\r\n\r\n“This is just the halfway point,” Ekeland said.\r\n\r\nDuring the monthlong trial, prosecutors showed jurors how the government traced the flow of crypto from darknet markets through Bitcoin Fog. They also highlighted a multistep process they say Sterlingov used to pay for the Bitcoin Fog domain name more than a decade ago.\r\n\r\nThe government also turned to two other crypto criminals to testify about mixers: Ilya Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty to a money laundering conspiracy last year, and Larry Harmon, who admitted to running a mixer called Helix. \r\n\r\nLichtenstein, who was charged along with his social-media rapper wife, told jurors he used Bitcoin Fog to launder some of the $4.5 billion (roughly Rs. 37,977 crore) in crypto stolen from the hack of Bitfinex. Both he and Harmon said they didn\'t know Sterlingov.\r\n\r\nSterlingov testified he worked in information technology and helped create domain names for clients while employed by a marketing and web firm and as a freelancer. He said he didn\'t remember whether he created the Bitcoin Fog domain name and doubted that he\'d done so. He also didn\'t recall certain transactions, noting they\'d happened long ago. \r\n\r\nThe government said it found some small-value transactions that originated from an account registered in Sterlingov\'s name that appeared to test Bitcoin Fog before it launched in 2011. Sterlingov has said he was a user of Bitcoin Fog, but didn\'t collect fees as the government claimed.\r\n\r\n“There is no evidence anywhere that Mr. Sterlingov operated Bitcoin Fog,” including no eyewitness accounts or server logs, Ekeland told jurors during closing arguments. \r\n\r\nThe government didn\'t find any references to Bitcoin Fog on Sterlingov\'s electronic devices or notebooks, Ekeland said. He also questioned the logic of Sterlingov using a secretive multistep process to fund Bitcoin Fog when the transaction started with an easily-traceable account registered in Sterlingov\'s name.\r\n\r\nThe defense also questioned the reliability of Wall Street-backed firm Chainalysis, which the Justice Department and Treasury Department have consistently used to help trace the flow of crypto in money laundering cases. \r\n\r\nThe government said that the company is reliable, and the judge agreed. Prosecutors said they also used other methods to link Sterlingov to operating Bitcoin Fog. Chainalysis has previously called attacks on its credibility a “fundraising ploy” and an effort to assist the crypto world escape accountability.', 'news-2-crime.png.png'),
(16, 'Crime', 'Cheese Heists On The Rise: How Organised Crime Is Exploiting Dairy IndustryCheese theft has become part of a broader rise in food-related crimes, which is costing the global food industry billions each year', 'A daring heist in the UK in October put the spotlight on the profitable but risky world of luxury cheese. The incident, dubbed “the grate cheese robbery,” saw 22 tonnes of premium British cheese disappear after a fraudulent order was placed under the guise of a French supermarket chain. The stolen consignment, valued at over £300,000 (around Rs 3.26 crore), comprised specialty cheese from farms in Somerset, including Hafod, a rare cheddar aged for 18 months.\r\n\r\nPatrick Holden, the dairy farmer behind Hafod, was initially thrilled by what he believed to be the largest order his farm had ever received. “It was the biggest order for our cheese we\'ve ever received,” Holden told BBC, adding, “And, because it was from France, I thought, ‘finally, people on the continent are appreciating what we do\'.”\r\n\r\nHis excitement waned when the order turned out to be a scam, and the cheese disappeared after being collected by a courier. In late October, a 63-year-old man was arrested in London, he was later released on bail. Since then, there have been no updates, and the 950 truckles of cheese – around the weight of four full-size elephants – disappeared without a trace.\r\n\r\nThe stolen cheese, including £35,000 (around Rs 38.13 lakh) worth of Hafod, was processed through Neal\'s Yard Dairy, an upmarket London wholesaler. The heist shocked the cheese industry, which the criminals have targeted due to the rising value of luxury dairy products.\r\n\r\nWhile the scale of the cheese theft was extraordinary, it is part of a broader rise in food-related crimes that cost the global food industry billions each year. Cheese, especially high-end varieties, has become an attractive target for organised criminals. From smuggling and counterfeiting to outright theft, food-related crimes have flourished, with some gangs specialising in stealing valuable products like Parmigiano Reggiano and cheddar.\r\n\r\n“Cheesemaking is an energy-intensive business,” the BBC quoted Patrick McGuigan, a dairy sector specialist, as saying. “There was a big price increase following the disruption caused by Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine,” added McGuigan. The economic impact of the war and ongoing inflation has made cheese increasingly expensive, driving demand among criminals seeking to profit from this lucrative market.\r\n\r\nNotably, the price of cheese in the UK has increased of late, with some varieties seeing price hikes of up to 6.5% in just 2024. “Based on price alone, cheese is one of the most desirable foods a criminal can steal,” McGuigan said.\r\n\r\nLuxury cheese theft is not only about high prices. Food holds additional appeal for criminal networks. Andy Quinn of the National Food Crime Unit (NFCU) said, “They (criminals) know crimes involving food result in less severe convictions than for importing drugs, but they can still make similar amounts of money.” It\'s especially true when it comes to premium cheese.\r\n\r\nThe black market for stolen cheese is global. In 2016, £80,000 worth of Parmigiano Reggiano was stolen in Italy.\r\n\r\n“Cheese and wine are two of the most common products being transported illegally into Russia,” says Professor Chris Elliott, founder of the Global Institute for Food Security.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Parmigiano Reggiano Consortium is tackling black market theft of its prized cheese by embedding tiny tracking chips in the rind. These chips, no bigger than a grain of rice, contain unique digital IDs to verify authenticity and detect stolen cheese. Buyers can scan the cheese to check its legitimacy, though the consortium has not yet released data on the impact of this technology on fraud.', 'news-3-crime.png.png'),

However, Suriya\'s latest film received a big shout out from wife Jyotika. Jyotika shared a poster featuring the lead man and Bobby Deol on her Instagram feed and wrote an elaborate note encapsulating her thoughts and feelings. The Shaitaan actor also addressed the issue of Kanguva receiving negative reviews on its very first day of release. Jyotika began her post with a disclaimer that she articulated her thoughts as a cinema lover and not as Suriya\'s wife. Jyotika wrote, \"I pen this note as Jyotika and a cinema lover and not actor Suriya\'s wife - Kanguva - a spectacle in cinema.\r\n\r\nSo proud of you Suriya, for the actor you are and how you dare to dream to take cinema forward. Definitely the first 1/2 hr doesn\'t work and the sound is jarring! Flaws are a part of most Indian films, so that\'s only fair, especially in this kind of a film wherein one experiments largely!

N what about Kanguva\'s positives? The women action sequence in 2nd half and the young boy\'s love and betrayal for Kanguva? I think they forgot about the good parts while reviewing.\r\n\r\nNow this Makes me wonder largely whether one should ever read, listen or believe them after all!

(24, 'Entertainment', ' Freedom At Midnight Review: Crafted With Utmost Diligence, The Show Gives History Its DueFreedom at Midnight isn\'t driven by A-list stars but by actors who painstakingly and confidently flesh out the towering historical figures', 'In Freedom of Midnight, showrunner and director Nikkhil Advani, working with a script by a team of six writers, blends solid historicity with elements of fiction and imagination to bring to the screen the agonizing final leg of India\'s freedom struggle.    \r\n\r\nThe SonyLIV drama series produced by Emmay Entertainment and StudioNext, is crafted with utmost diligence. It blends grandeur with intimacy, swept with precision, sustained gravitas with an acute awareness of the timeless contemporaneity of political decisions of far-reaching consequences made in an era of great upheavals by the architects of a free nation forged in fire.  \r\n\r\nThe canvas of Freedom at Midnight, based principally on the 1975 book of the same name by Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, is vast, although the main narrative spans only two years and stops with the uncertain future that a newly independent India stares at amid the Partition riots.\r\n\r\nFreedom at Midnight has a cast of hundreds but it zeroes in on a handful of men, and a woman or two, who led the negotiations for the transfer of power, a slow and painful process that was inevitably fraught with much tension and to-ing and fro-ing.\r\n\r\nAdvani, whose 2003 directorial debut Kal Ho Naa Ho re-releases today, has traversed many a mile as a filmmaker and storyteller since then. His Rocket Boys imbues Freedom at Midnight with the gravitas that it demands. \r\n\r\nThe artistic choices that the director makes are spot on. The actors at his disposal are perfectly attuned to the demands of the project. And the technical attributes of the show are all first-rate. Together, they not only ensure that the spotlight does not shift an inch from the solemn subject matter but also that the burden does not weigh down the endeavour. \r\n  \r\nNo matter what your political leanings are and how much of your knowledge of history is coloured by WhatsApp forwards, you will find it difficult to fault the points of emphasis and the lines of argument that Advani\'s interpretation of events employs because it is clearly based on extensive research and a book that got everything right, give or take a few stray departures.\r\n\r\nIf there is anything that is amiss in Freedom at Midnight, it is the fact that each of the key dramatic personae is put into an airtight ideological block that represents a specific line of thinking that is played off against the swirling forces of history for the purpose of generating drama and conflict. \r\n\r\nGandhi is the sage, Nehru an idealist committed to the idea of a unified India, Patel a pragmatist who believes it is fine to amputate a hand to save the arm, and Jinnah an unbudging votary of a separate nation for Muslims. The show does not have much scope for these remarkable men to succumb to human inconsistencies.  \r\n           \r\nFreedom at Midnight isn\'t driven by A-list stars but by actors who painstakingly and confidently flesh out the aforementioned towering historical figures. Their task is onerous, and even though not all of them may bear exact resemblance to the leaders they play, they succeed in making us believe that they are indeed the men that they portray.\r\n\r\nSidhant Gupta, who broke out in the role of a budding filmmaker in Vikramaditya Motwane\'s Jubilee, adds another feather to his cap with his performance as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. \r\n\r\nThe show presents India\'s first Prime Minister as a suave barrister who is perfectly at home in the rough and tumble of politics even as he struggles to wrap his head around the idea of cleaving the subcontinent into two. The fact that Gupta, a thirty-something actor, is consistently convincing as Nehru in his late 50s, is no less than a marvel.\r\n\r\nRajendra Chawla delivers on all fronts as Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, projected as a hardnosed man of action who readily embraces the proposal of Partition because he wants to stop the seeds of religious hatred and distrust from spreading across the country.\r\n        \r\nChirag Vohra is a bold choice for the character of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. It comes off because once the wall of disbelief is breached, he grows on the audience.\r\n\r\nAt the other end of the spectrum is Arif Zakaria as a tubercular Mohammed Ali Jinnah. Although the character is bereft of shades, the actor is never short of impressive. He is the least conflicted of the main players in Freedom at Midnight and yet Zakaria manages to impart to him significant angularities. \r\n\r\nWhen Jinnah\'s younger sister Fatima (Ira Dubey, one of the few women in the cast who isn\'t relegated to the sidelines) points out to him that regional identity is stronger than the religious one, he brushes it off without letting the argument go any further. He goes in just one direction and nowhere else and that robs the portrayal of nuance.\r\n          \r\nBut that certainly isn\'t the bane of the series as a whole. Freedom at Midnight chooses sustained engagement over mere entertainment as it makes its way through the battlefield on which the clash between conflicting notions of nation and identity played out and presents a composite of resonant, eternally relevant notions.\r\n\r\nNo historical drama can be deemed successful unless it contains within its folds the lessons that are to be learnt from the watersheds that shape nations, communities and political formations. Freedom at Midnight does not fail to dwell upon the consequences of decisions taken under duress and in response to raging conflagrations.\r\n\r\nAlthough the series depicts events that occurred over 75 years ago, it has many meaningful asides that constitute a commentary on the realities of the times that we live in. \r\n\r\nBut even if one were to miss these piercing truths about shaking off the yoke of foreign rule, the pursuit of principles in the face of grave provocations and the dichotomy of power and duty, Freedom at Midnight has enough to keep the audience invested in the unfolding of the drama of a nation seeking to steady itself on dangerously slippery ground.\r\n\r\nNot only is it competently crafted and acted, it also tells a story replete with known and unknown nuggets of information that are processed with skill and sensitivity. It has no grandstanding, and no hectoring and hollering of the sort that mainstream Bollywood is prone to. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe show gives history its due, meticulously piecing together the fragments that went into the making of an essential and wondrous, if inevitably imperfect, whole.                    \r\n', 'news-2-entertainment.png.png'),

', 'On a tense night in 1989 in Mumbai, a mother and a child had to visit a hospital. There were restrictions on the roads due to violence in the area. With no transport available, a young auto-rickshaw driver, who lived in a chawl, drove the duo to the hospital. It\'s a story etched in the memory of the neighbourhood where the auto-driver is believed to have spent decades of his life. \r\nThirty-three years after risking his life that night, the man, Eknath Shinde, was sworn in as the 20th Chief Minister of Maharashtra. His wasn\'t a meteoric rise. But when his moment came in July 2022, Mr Shinde seized it, successfully leading a rebellion against what was considered a stable Maha Vikas Agadhi government under Shiv Sena\'s Uddhav Thackeray.  \r\n\r\nEknath Shinde was born into a Maratha family on February 9, 1964, in Dare village of Maharashtra\'s Satara district. They later moved to Thane, a city on the outskirts of Mumbai, where he grew up. Mr Shinde attended Mangala High School & Junior College in Thane, studying up to class 11. He left school early to support his family financially and worked as an auto-rickshaw driver before joining politics. \r\n\r\nEknath Shinde resumed his studies in 2014. In 2020, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University.\r\n\r\nEntry To Politics\r\n\r\nEknath Shinde\'s political journey began in the early 1980s when he was introduced to politics by Anand Dighe, the then-Thane Shiv Sena President. Initially, Eknath Shinde led Shiv Sena\'s agitation in the Wagle Estate area, where he emerged as a prominent labour leader. In 1984, he was appointed as Sakha Pramukh in Thane. Mr Shinde\'s political ascent continued with his election as a corporator to the Thane Municipal Corporation in 1997, and his subsequent appointment as Leader of the House in 2001. \r\n\r\nHe emerged as the heir to Anand Dighe\'s legacy after the leader\'s death in 2001. \r\n\r\nPolitical Career\r\n\r\nEknath Shinde\'s success in local politics paved the way for his entry into the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly. First elected to the Assembly in 2004, he was appointed as the Thane district head of Shiv Sena a year later. Over the years, Eknath Shinde\'s political influence continued to grow, with his re-election to the Assembly in 2009, 2014 and 2019.\r\n\r\nDuring his time in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, Eknath Shinde held several key positions. From 2014 to 2019, he served as the minister for public works (public undertakings) and was also the guardian minister of Thane district. In 2018, he was appointed the Leader of the Shiv Sena in the Assembly. He was later appointed as the minister for public health and family welfare in 2019 and also served as the minister of urban development and public works and acting minister of home affairs in late 2019.  \r\n\r\nKey Positions Held\r\n\r\nMember of Legislative Assembly (MLA): Eknath Shinde has been an MLA for the Kopri-Pachpakhadi constituency since 2009.\r\nCabinet Minister: He served as the PWD minister in the Devendra Fadnavis-led government (2014-2019).\r\nLeader of the Opposition: Eknath Shinde led the Shiv Sena legislature party in the Maharashtra Assembly.\r\nChief Ministership\r\n\r\nDuring his time as a minister in Devendra Fadnavis\' first term as Maharashtra Chief Minister, Eknath Shinde is believed to have built closer ties with him. In 2022, he led a revolt within the Shiv Sena, pushing for a breakup of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance and a reestablishment of ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mr Shinde cited ideological differences and dissatisfaction with the Congress and NCP\'s treatment of Shiv Sena. His grievances, shared by many within his party, led him to gather support from two-thirds of Shiv Sena\'s MLAs. \r\n\r\nIn June 2022, Eknath Shinde and several MLAs moved to Surat, Gujarat, triggering a political crisis. As a result, Uddhav Thackeray resigned as Chief Minister, and Eknath Shinde successfully formed a new government with the BJP. He was sworn in as the 20th Chief Minister of Maharashtra in June 2022, with BJP\'s Devendra Fadnavis as Deputy Chief Minister.\r\n\r\nShiv Sena\r\n\r\nAfter assuming the Chief Minister\'s post, Eknath Shinde staked claim to the party name and symbols, feuding with Uddhav Thackeray. The matter was taken to court, and then the Election Commission of India recognised Mr Shinde\'s faction as the official Shiv Sena. The Commission also criticised the amendments made to the party\'s constitution under Uddhav Thackeray in 2018, deeming them undemocratic and unduly centralised.\r\n\r\nOn February 4, 2024, Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar ruled that Eknath Shinde\'s faction was the \"real Shiv Sena\" political party. This decision dealt a major blow to Uddhav Thackeray.\r\n\r\nUnder Eknath Shinde\'s leadership, the Shiv Sena managed to win only seven seats during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The Uddhav Thackeray-led faction, on the other hand, won nine, hinting at a potential political renaissance ahead of the November Assembly elections.\r\n\r\nMaharashtra Assembly Elections 2024\r\n\r\nEknath Shinde is contesting the upcoming elections from his stronghold of Kopri-Pachpakhadi Assembly constituency in Thane on November 20.

The notice sparked a political storm in the state and opposition leaders accused Mr Shinde\'s government of financial mismanagement and overspending.\r\nIn September, the Maharashtra CM and his government came under fire for the delay in capturing the culprits in the Badlapur sexual assault case. Eknath Shinde then courted controversy for defending the police, who killed Akshay Shinde, the man accused of sexually assaulting two young girls in Badlapur. The chief minister\'s defence came despite the Bombay High Court raising questions over the custodial death of the accused, saying, \"This cannot be termed an encounter\".\r\nMr Shinde\'s governance has also come under severe criticism over the law and order situation in the state.

Found at the Nahal Ein Gev II site in northern Israel, these 12,000-year-old limestone pebbles feature central holes and are thought to have been used as spindle whorls—a tool for spinning fibres like flax and wool.\r\n\r\nTalia Yashuv, a graduate student and co-author of the study at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem\'s Institute of Archaeology, told LiveScience that these ancient artefacts suggest early experimentation with rotational tools that could have laid the foundation for later advancements like the potter\'s wheel and the cart wheel. This discovery was published in PLOS One on November 13, offering a glimpse into pre-agricultural technology in the region.\r\n\r\nEarly Rotational Tools Investigated\r\nThe roughly 100 perforated pebbles were analysed by Yashuv and Leore Grosman, a professor of prehistoric archaeology at the same institute. After scanning each pebble in 3D, the team produced detailed models to assess their potential uses. Most of the pebbles were thought unlikely to serve as fishing weights or beads due to their size and shape, which diverge from artefacts used in similar periods. Instead, the team recreated spindle whorls from the scanned models, which traditional craft expert Yonit Crystal used to spin flax and wool. While the flax was easier to handle, the replicas demonstrated that the pebbles were likely effective as spindle whorls, supporting early textile production, the study noted.\r\n\r\nImplications of the Findings\r\nThe findings indicate that these spindle whorls could mark a key point in technological evolution, potentially linked to new methods of storage and survival. Alex Joffe, a director at the Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa and experienced archaeologist, told LiveScience that the possibility that these artefacts could have enabled innovations like bags or fishing lines. Yorke Rowan, an archaeology professor at the University of Chicago, echoed this view, noting that the analysis represents a \"critical turning point\" in early technology.\r\n\r\nA Continuing Debate\r\nWhile these pebbles may represent one of the earliest uses of wheel-like forms, Carole Cheval, an expert in prehistoric textiles at CEPAM in France, told that the publication that she observed that similar objects have been found in other regions, possibly from earlier periods.

Other companies have navigated California\'s regulatory maze and completed millions of autonomous-vehicle testing miles under state oversight, according to a Reuters review of state regulatory data.\r\n\r\nIf Musk can succeed in securing federal regulations or laws that preempt state oversight, experts in autonomous-vehicle regulation said, it could allow Tesla to sidestep regulations in California.\r\n\r\nTesla has logged just 562 testing miles since 2016 and hasn\'t filed autonomous-driving reports to California regulators since 2019, state records show. Alphabet\'s Waymo, by comparison, logged more than 13 million testing miles and secured seven different regulatory approvals between 2014 and 2023, when it received approval to charge passengers for rides in driverless robotaxis. Waymo is among just three companies with California permits to commercially operate driverless vehicles and the only one approved to operate a robotaxi fleet anything like what Musk envisions.\r\n\r\nWaymo declined to comment on Tesla\'s regulatory strategy or its approach to autonomous driving.\r\n\r\nTesla currently has the lowest-level California permit, which allows testing with human-driver oversight. Only six companies have driverless-testing approvals. California data for those firms shows each tested with a driver for a minimum of three years, often for millions of miles, before securing driverless-testing approvals. Amazon\'s Zoox, for instance, logged more than 1.6 million miles over three years. General Motors\' Cruise racked up more than 2.1 million miles over five years.\r\n\r\nCruise declined to comment. Zoox said it also has a separate driverless \"pilot\" permit from California regulators that allows the company to pick up passengers without charging fares.\r\n\r\n\"Tesla has that entire journey in front of them,\" said Phil Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University engineering professor and autonomous-vehicle safety expert. He said Tesla\'s current \"Full Self-Driving\" (FSD) system - which actually requires a human driver paying strict attention - is \"nowhere near ready to be a robotaxi.\"\r\n\r\nMusk says self-driving Teslas will be ready next year, echoing unfulfilled promises dating back about a decade. He has increasingly bet Tesla\'s future on robotaxis since this spring, when Reuters reported the automaker had scrapped plans for a mass-market affordable car for human drivers amid softening electric-vehicle demand and rising competition from cheap Chinese EVs.\r\n\r\nHe told investors last month at a Hollywood-style robotaxi unveiling near Los Angeles that Tesla would deploy fully autonomous versions of its Model 3 and Model Y next year in Texas and California. He also unveiled a two-seat \"Cybercab\" robotaxi he says will start production in 2026 and cost \"roughly $25,000.\" Tesla stock fell 9% the next day as some underwhelmed investors said Musk\'s presentation lacked concrete product details. Since the election, however, Tesla shares have jumped more than 30%, adding nearly $200 billion in market value, as investors expect friendlier autonomous-driving and artificial-intelligence regulation.\r\n\r\n\'BILLIONS OF MILES\'\r\n\r\nTesla has lobbied for electric vehicle subsidies and other benefits over the years.\r\n\r\nThe company for years has also supported a federal standard for autonomous driving in discussions with Congress and NHTSA, but was unable to get one in place, in part because of a divided Congress, said two people familiar with the company\'s strategy. Tesla in 2018 signed a letter supporting a Senate bill that would have preempted some state regulation of autonomous vehicles, but the legislation never got a full Senate vote.\r\n\r\nIn recent months, Musk has emerged as a prominent member of Trump\'s inner circle.\r\n\r\nHe spent election night at Trump\'s Florida Mar-a-Lago club and has frequented the luxury compound since the former president\'s Nov. 5 victory, according to sources and videos posted by Republican operatives.\r\n\r\nMusk has attended at least one meeting at Mar-a-Lago about the appointment of a senior cabinet position, Treasury secretary, according to a second person familiar with the matter.\r\n\r\nA Trump spokesperson did not answer questions about autonomous driving regulations or Musk\'s influence but said \"our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency.\"\r\n\r\nUnder a Trump administration, NHTSA could design accommodating autonomous-vehicle standards but a key question would be whether the regulator could or would prevent states from passing their own stricter rules, three legal and regulatory experts told Reuters.\r\n\r\nA Republican-controlled Congress also could enact a national approval process that supersedes state laws. NHTSA has traditionally regulated the design of vehicles while states primarily regulate drivers and set traffic laws - a split that isn\'t clear once the car itself becomes the driver. Bryant Walker Smith, a University of South Carolina law professor who focuses on autonomous driving, said NHTSA could interpret its authority more broadly if it \"was being directed to achieve a certain political outcome.\"\r\n\r\nUnder Trump, NHTSA could clear the path for more novel designs like that of the Cybercab, which Musk says will have no steering wheel or pedals.\r\n\r\nNational autonomous-vehicle regulation is more important to Tesla than its rivals because Tesla has a different business model. Musk\'s strategy involves selling millions of vehicles that can drive themselves anywhere on earth. Almost all other competitors, including Waymo, operate robotaxi fleets in limited, comprehensively mapped zones of specific cities.\r\n\r\nWaymo and others build more expensive robotaxis that are equipped with suites of redundant technologies and sensors, including radar and lidar, which uses lasers to detect objects and create three-dimensional images of a vehicle\'s surroundings. Tesla relies solely on \"computer vision,\" which seeks to use cameras like humans use eyes, with artificial intelligence that translates images into driving decisions.\r\n\r\nAsked on a July earnings call how he would overcome regulatory challenges, Musk said Tesla would have \"billions of miles\" showing FSD is safer than a human driver and that regulators would be \"morally obligated to approve.\"\r\n\r\nBut Tesla so far has little to show regulators. The California Department of Motor Vehicles told Reuters Tesla had not sought driverless-testing or deployment permits required to operate driverless vehicles on public roads. California would be critical to any rollout of what Musk calls a Tesla \"robotaxi network,\" which he has said could offer rides in both Tesla- and customer-owned taxis. About 37% of all Teslas on US roads are in California, according to industry data provider Experian Automotive.\r\n\r\nWaymo is now the only company with California approval to charge passengers for rides in driverless taxis. It wasn\'t easy.\r\n\r\nWaymo first secured a permit in 2014 to test with a safety driver. It got a driverless-testing permit four years later, in October 2018, after logging more than 2.2 million test miles. It took three more years and 3.7 million more testing miles to secure approval from the California DMV to commercially operate autonomous vehicles - with a human driver onboard - in San Francisco and parts of San Mateo County. Waymo logged another 7.4 million miles before winning approval in August 2023 to charge customers for rides in driverless robotaxis in San Francisco, state records show. Waymo also currently operates in Los Angeles and Phoenix.\r\n\r\nGM\'s Cruise also operated driverless-taxis in San Francisco but had its permit suspended after an October 2023 incident where a Cruise vehicle dragged a pedestrian who had been hit by another car for 20 feet.\r\n\r\nLESS REGULATION, MORE LEGAL RISK\r\n\r\nTesla faces different but still-difficult challenges in less-regulated states including Texas, which has almost no restrictions and specifically forbids cities from regulating driverless vehicles.\r\n\r\nBut Tesla would face immense legal liability for crashes the moment it claims its vehicles are fully autonomous. The automaker has until now blamed Tesla drivers in defending itself against lawsuits and regulatory investigations over accidents involving FSD and Autopilot. Tesla argues it warns drivers to pay attention because those systems aren\'t fully autonomous.\r\n\r\nIf Tesla felt comfortable deploying self-driving technology in low-regulation states like Texas, then \"presumably they would be doing it,\" said Smith, the University of South Carolina law professor. But \"once you say there is no need for a human to pay attention, then you\'re pointing the finger back at yourself\" when it comes to crash liability.\r\n\r\nInsuring driverless Teslas would be another major challenge. Individual consumers can\'t currently buy a fully autonomous vehicle - and so no insurance for one exists, said Bob Passmore, a vice president specializing in home and auto insurance for the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, a trade group. He said corporate autonomous vehicle operators currently get insurance through commercial policies or through specialty \"surplus lines\" policies for unusual cases.\r\n\r\nMany state laws are similar to Texas, allowing registered driverless vehicles mostly unfettered access to roads, according to a Reuters review of the statutes. Others impose more restrictions: Nevada requires driverless-vehicle firms to get a testing certificate and use employees as safety drivers. Kentucky and South Dakota require vehicles to be able to pull safely off the road if they encounter problems. Fifteen of the 50 US states have no laws specific to driverless-vehicles, according to the Autonomous Vehicle Industry Association, a trade group.\r\n\r\nLight or nonexistent regulations could heighten the legal risk because autonomous-vehicle companies couldn\'t argue they complied with strict government safety standards, said three experts in autonomous-driving law. California\'s tougher regulations help protect companies securing approvals, which could provide \"powerful\" evidence for a defense if permitted firms get sued over crashes, said William Widen, a University of Miami law professor specializing in autonomous-vehicle liability.\r\n\r\n\"The lawyers would always rather have the blessing of regulators,\" he said, because it provides evidence that the company wasn\'t \"behaving recklessly or negligently, and that they complied with all applicable laws.\"\r\n\r\n', 'news-3-technology.png.png'),

(33, 'Health', 'As Delhi Pollution Worsens, Experts Advice On Tackling Cardio, Breathing Problems According to experts, hazardous air quality is linked to lower life expectancy, heart disease, and respiratory issues.', 'Delhi\'s Worsening Air Quality\r\nDelhi-NCR and several other regions of the country have been witnessing alarming rise in pollution levels. Presently, in Delhi-NCR Air Quality Index (AIX) is hovering around 300-400 range and has even gone up to over 500. Air pollution poses a severe health risk, especially in winter when vehicle emissions, industrial pollutants, and stubble burning combine to create high smog levels. According to experts, hazardous air quality is linked to lower life expectancy, heart disease, and respiratory issues. Children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions are particularly susceptible to the long-term impacts of this exposure, they warned. \r\n\r\nWhat Are The Health Risks?\r\n\r\nThe World Heart Federation\'s (WHF) World Heart Report 2024, reveals alarming statistics on the relationship between air pollution and cardiovascular disease (CVD) globally. In India, a country already burdened with a high prevalence of CVDs, the impact of environmental factors, particularly air pollution, poses a significant public health challenge. According to the report, air pollution exacerbates all major CVDs, including ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, which together account for millions of deaths annually. Globally, air pollution contributed to 22% of deaths from IHD and 15% from strokes in 2019. In India, where urbanization and industrialization continue to rise, the situation is even more critical. The dense air pollution across the country, exacerbated by agricultural residue burning in Punjab and Haryana, is contributing to the growing burden of heart disease.\r\n\r\nCardiovascular Problems - What Doctors Say\r\n\r\nEmphasizing the clinical mechanisms through which pollution impacts heart health Dr. Faraz Ahmed Farooqui, Consultant- Cardiology, PSRI Hospital said \"Long-term exposure to air pollution leads to endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress, both of which are critical precursors to cardiovascular diseases. In India, the incidence of conditions such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure has seen a marked increase in polluted areas. These pollutants not only increase blood pressure but also trigger inflammatory responses in the blood vessels, accelerating atherosclerosis, which further heightens the risk of heart attacks and strokes.\"\r\n\r\nThe World Heart Report also highlights how particulate matter from agricultural practices, particularly residue burning in North India, significantly impacts air quality. The plumes from burning crop stubble contribute to spikes in particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), aggravating the cardiovascular health of millions.\r\n\r\nDr. Rajendra Patil, Consultant - Cardiology, Jupiter Hospital said, \"The health effects of air pollution are especially pronounced among women and children in rural areas due to household air pollution from biomass cooking. Studies have shown that long-term exposure leads to higher instances of hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart disease. We need to accelerate the shift towards cleaner cooking alternatives and ensure that public health interventions target these vulnerable populations. Also, Diabetes and obesity, both of which are widely prevalent in India and are major risk factors for CVDs. It shows that air pollution worsens glucose handling, increases insulin resistance, and exacerbates the risk of diabetes-related heart conditions. \"\r\n\r\n\"Patients with existing comorbidities like diabetes and obesity are doubly impacted by air pollution. Air pollution worsens metabolic syndromes, making cardiovascular events more frequent. We have observed an increase in diabetic patients experiencing heart failure and ischemic heart disease, especially during periods of high pollution. There is an urgent need to raise awareness about the link between air pollution and cardiovascular health. Given the current situation, we strongly advocate for stronger environmental policies at local and national levels,” added Dr. Sukriti Bhalla, Senior Consultant- Cardiology at Aakash Healthcare.\r\n\r\nRespiratory Issues\r\n\r\nDr Praveen Gupta, Principal Director & Chief of Neurology, Fortis Hospital, pointed out, \"Pollution causes a significant impact on human health. It can exacerbate respiratory problems such as COPD and asthma. It increases the risk of heart disease. It is also a leading risk factor of stroke, cognitive impairment, and dementia. Pollution has a negative influence on mental health, producing loss of focus, irritation, and brain fog. There is mounting evidence that exposure to air pollution increases the risk of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers and Parkinson\'s. Poor air quality has a substantial impact on our mental health, increasing the risk of anxiety and depression.”\r\n\r\nThe primary causes of this heightened risk include traffic exhaust fumes, home wood burning, and elevated levels of nitrogen dioxide, which can be ascribed to industrial emissions, gardening equipment, power plants, and construction and exhaust fumes. But that does not mean we should resign and accept air pollution as a part of our daily life. We can take steps decrease air pollution in their communities, such as utilizing public transportation wherever feasible, reducing the use of wood and coal in the house, repairing cars on a regular basis, and inspecting tires often. We may also avoid being exposed to high levels of air pollution by limiting the amount of time we spend in regions with high amounts of traffic or other pollutants, as well as using filtration systems to keep the air in our homes pure.\" Dr Gupta added.\r\n\r\nIn addition to outdoor air pollution, household air pollution remains a significant issue in India, where millions of households rely on biomass for cooking. This form of pollution is associated with increased mortality from ischemic heart disease and stroke, with women and children in rural areas being particularly vulnerable.\r\n\r\nExperts are now calling for urgent attention and action to address these environmental triggers of CVDs. Indian cardiologists and public health professionals emphasize that without addressing pollution, tackling cardiovascular health challenges will remain an uphill battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'news-2-health.png.png'),
(34, 'Health', 'Can Eating Junk Food Increase The Risk Of These Common Fatty Liver diseases? This article explores how eating junk food raises the risk of fatty liver diseases, examines symptoms, and highlights specific foods that can negatively impact liver health.', 'The prevalence of fatty liver disease is rising globally, with lifestyle factors such as diet playing a central role in its development. Fatty liver disease, which occurs when excess fat builds up in liver cells, is commonly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD). Recent studies show that consuming high-fat, high-sugar foods—often the primary components of junk food—can increase the risk of these liver conditions. Many types of junk food are high in refined carbohydrates, unhealthy fats, and artificial additives, all of which contribute to fat accumulation in the liver. This article explores how eating junk food raises the risk of fatty liver diseases, examines symptoms, and highlights specific foods that can negatively impact liver health.\r\nUnderstanding fatty liver diseases and their symptoms\r\nFatty liver disease is generally classified into two types: alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Both types result in fat accumulation in the liver, but NAFLD is associated with dietary habits and is not caused by alcohol consumption, whereas AFLD is directly linked to excessive alcohol intake.\r\n\r\nCommon Fatty Liver Diseases\r\na. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD): This condition involves fat build-up in the liver and can progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis, or cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nb. Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (AFLD): This form occurs in individuals with heavy alcohol use, increasing the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of Fatty Liver Disease\r\nIn the early stages, fatty liver disease often has few or no symptoms, but as the condition progresses, symptoms may include the following.\r\n\r\n1. Fatigue and weakness\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Pain or discomfort in the upper right abdomen\r\n\r\n3. Unexplained weight loss\r\n\r\n4. Yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice)\r\n\r\n5. Swelling in the abdomen or legs (in advanced stages)\r\n\r\nEarly intervention and dietary modifications can often prevent or slow the progression of fatty liver disease.\r\n\r\nHow junk food contributes to fatty liver disease\r\nResearch shows that diets high in processed foods and added sugars lead to an increased risk of fatty liver disease. The liver processes fructose and glucose (found in sugary drinks and snacks), converting the excess into fat that is then stored in the liver. Junk foods loaded with trans fats and refined carbohydrates contribute to inflammation, insulin resistance, and fat storage, which can ultimately lead to fatty liver disease.\r\n\r\n7 foods that may increase the risk of fatty liver disease\r\n1. Sugary drinks and sodas\r\nSugary beverages like sodas and energy drinks are high in fructose, which is metabolised in the liver. High fructose consumption leads to fat deposits in the liver, contributing to NAFLD. Regular intake of sugary drinks has been linked to liver inflammation, insulin resistance, and increased liver fat.\r\n\r\n2. Processed meats\r\nProcessed meats like sausages, bacon, and hot dogs are high in unhealthy fats and preservatives. These foods increase oxidative stress in the liver, leading to inflammation and fat accumulation. The saturated fats in processed meats make it harder for the liver to break down fats, further promoting fat buildup.\r\n\r\n3. Fast food\r\nFast foods, including burgers, fries, and fried chicken, are high in trans fats and refined carbohydrates, both of which contribute to fatty liver. Trans fats are especially harmful, as they increase cholesterol levels and worsen insulin resistance, exacerbating the progression of liver disease.\r\n\r\n4. White bread and pastries\r\nWhite bread, pastries, and other refined carbohydrates can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels. This leads to insulin resistance over time, which can promote fat storage in the liver. The lack of fibre in refined carbohydrates also limits digestive health, contributing to weight gain and fat buildup in the liver.\r\n\r\n5. Sugary cereals\r\nBreakfast cereals that are high in added sugars and refined grains have been shown to increase liver fat. These cereals cause blood sugar spikes, which, over time, contribute to insulin resistance and fat accumulation. Additionally, many cereals lack essential nutrients that support liver health.\r\n\r\n6. Ice cream and high-sugar desserts\r\nDesserts like ice cream and pastries are often loaded with sugar and unhealthy fats. These foods stimulate fat storage in the liver, and regular consumption can increase the risk of NAFLD. The high sugar content can also lead to oxidative stress in liver cells, accelerating liver damage.\r\n\r\n7. Fried and salty snacks\r\nFried snacks such as potato chips and salted crackers are high in trans fats and salt. These foods increase inflammation in the liver and can lead to fluid retention, causing liver strain. The salt also contributes to high blood pressure, which further exacerbates liver health issues in individuals with fatty liver disease.\r\n\r\nThe connection between junk food consumption and fatty liver disease is well-documented, with various foods exacerbating liver fat storage and contributing to NAFLD and AFLD. Understanding the effects of sugary drinks, processed meats, fast food, and refined carbohydrates on liver health is crucial for making healthier dietary choices. Reducing intake of junk food and replacing it with liver-friendly foods, such as whole grains, lean proteins, and fibre-rich vegetables, can significantly lower the risk of fatty liver disease. By adopting a balanced diet and practicing moderation, individuals can support their liver health, prevent liver damage, and enhance overall well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\nListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\r\n', 'news-3-health.png.png'),
